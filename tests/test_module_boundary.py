"""The module boundary, asserted rather than hoped for.

``docs/EXTRACTION.md`` states the rule: *JaegerAgent depends on JaegerOS.
JaegerAI depends on JaegerAgent. JaegerAgent must never import JaegerAI.*

Nothing enforced it, and 54 imports accumulated. They are lazy (inside
functions), so the package still imports with no host installed and the
rest of the suite still passes — which is exactly why this went unnoticed:
**the suite proves the package IMPORTS standalone, not that it RUNS
standalone.** Every one of those 54 call sites is untested.

These tests are a RATCHET, not a gate. They pin today's number so it can
only fall. Nobody has to fix 54 imports to land a change; nobody gets to
add a 55th by accident either.

When you remove some, lower the budget in the same commit. That edit is
the point — it is the only place the number is written down, so the
diff shows the boundary moving.

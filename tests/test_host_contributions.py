"""A host application can extend the agent, and what it adds is equal.

This is the property that makes the module embeddable rather than merely
importable: JaegerAI, Mochi, or a robot chassis contributes tools and
skills, and the agent treats them exactly like the ones it ships. If that
holds, an application is also the natural place to DEVELOP a capability —
build it against a real instance, prove it, and only then decide whether
it belongs in the module.

Three ways in, and all three must be equal:

  1. register a tool           the process-wide registry, read every turn
  2. register a toolset        so it survives a host that scopes
  3. drop a SKILL.md in the    instance skills/ dir, which discovery
     instance                  already merges with the bundled tree

Number 2 did not work before 1.0.7: runtime-registered toolsets lived in
one registry and ``resolve_toolsets`` read another, so naming one raised
``KeyError: unknown toolset``.

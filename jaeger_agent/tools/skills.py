"""The `list_skills` tool — discover and read playbook skills on demand.

A skill is an experienced playbook for a task — instructions plus, often,
runnable shell/Python or a ``scripts/`` folder. There are dozens; they
are NOT dumped into the prompt. The agent calls `list_skills` (action=
list/search/view/curate) to find the right skill for a task, then reads
it and follows it with its normal tools (``terminal``, ``execute_code``,
…). Its counterpart `use_skill` loads ONE recipe to follow. On-demand,
so the skill library never bloats context.

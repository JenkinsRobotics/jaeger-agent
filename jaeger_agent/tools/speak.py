"""Text-to-speech tool shims — route through the 0.4 TTS node.

  • speak(text=, path=) — publish /act/speech, wait for /sense/spoken
  • warm_tts()          — pre-load whatever fills the ``tts`` slot

0.4 rewire (Track B.2): the tool used to call ``KokoroTTS.speak()``
directly in-process.  It now publishes a :class:`SpeechCommand` on
the brain's bus and blocks until the TTS node returns a
:class:`SpokenAck` with the matching ``correlation_id``.

The agent's tool surface is unchanged — same function name, same
arguments, same return-dict shape.  What changed is who actually
runs the synthesis: the ``tts`` slot's node owns the engine, not this
module. 1.0.2 finished the job — no engine is named here any more.
That preserves the operator's lock-in: "**a tool does the
networking, the node does the execution**."

Sandbox check for ``path=`` stays here in core, BEFORE the bus
publish — file-resolution boundaries must hold regardless of which
TTS backend the node wraps.

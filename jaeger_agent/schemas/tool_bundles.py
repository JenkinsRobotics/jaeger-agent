"""Toolsets — group tools into named bundles so only the relevant
subset shows up in the model's tool catalogue per turn.

The Hermes pattern: every tool is tagged with a category, and the
agent loop only renders the tools belonging to the *active* toolsets.
For JROS that win is concrete — exposing ~80 tools every turn burns
~10K tokens of the 16K context just on schema, before any history or
results. Restricting to `{essentials, files, web}` drops that to
~2-3K and reclaims headroom for actual conversation.

Two surfaces:

  • :data:`JAEGER_TOOLSETS` — the canonical map of toolset name →
    (description, tool names, included toolsets). Centralised here
    rather than tagged on each ``ToolDef`` so adding a new toolset
    doesn't require touching 63 ``@register_tool_from_function`` sites
    in ``main.py``. Tool membership is DERIVED from
    ``skill_registry.toolset_scoping`` (CORE + TOOLSETS — the live
    visibility gate) rather than hand-maintained in parallel; only
    the bundle groupings/composites live here.

  • :func:`resolve_toolsets` — expand a set of toolset names to the
    union of tool names they contain. The agent loop's filter calls
    this once at format time.

Composition with ``includes`` mirrors Hermes' resolve algorithm so
``"default"`` can fan out to several atomic toolsets without
duplicating the tool lists.

Phase-7 first cut: opinionated defaults that match JROS's typical
chat-assistant workload. Toolsets evolve with usage data — the
``/runtime`` panel will eventually show "tools picked per toolset"
heatmaps so the splits track real routing behaviour.

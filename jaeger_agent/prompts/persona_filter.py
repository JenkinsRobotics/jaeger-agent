"""Station 3 — the persona output filter (docs/skills/agentic_runners.md).

Workers run vanilla: a character in the execution context costs a 4B ~7
bench points (measured in JaegerAI, dev/docs/reality/persona_compiler.md —
that's why assemble.py deliberately omits the persona fragment). The character's voice comes back HERE instead: one
bounded, clean-context call that restyles the FINAL answer only. The
filter's context is the answer + the compiled character block — no tools,
no history, no schemas — so personality tokens can never pollute execution.

Fail-open by design: any failure (model error, empty rewrite, oversized
input) returns the ORIGINAL answer untouched. Losing voice is acceptable;
losing the answer is not.

Applied only at the USER-FACING boundary in main.py — the bench drives the
loop directly and never passes through it, so the engine is always measured
persona-off. Kill switches: ``persona.output_filter: false`` in config, or
``JAEGER_PERSONA_FILTER=0`` in the environment.

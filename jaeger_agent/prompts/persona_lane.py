"""Persona Mode C — the id and the ego.

Design: dev/docs/roadmap/PERSONA_PIPELINE_ABC_DESIGN.md (Mode C section);
build plan: dev/docs/roadmap/PERSONA_MODE_C_BUILD_PLAN.md. Operator-
canonized framing, 2026-07-10:

The persona lane IS the id — desire, voice, character. It wants to answer
everything itself, in character, right now. The clean agent (driven here
through exactly ONE tool, ``perform_task``) is the ego: the reality
principle. A tool call is literally reality-testing. The permission tiers,
e-stop, and fail-closed gates elsewhere in the loop are the superego,
saying no regardless of what either the id or the ego wants. One property
makes this mode safe to ship: **the id never touches reality directly.**
Lilith cannot assert the time — she must go through the ego, which checks.
Every hallucination is an id answering a reality question it should have
delegated instead.

``run_persona_turn`` is the whole mechanism: a TEXT-dialect tool call
decides — call ``perform_task`` (the full clean agentic loop: persona-off,
every tool, the hardened prompt) or answer as the character. Delegation is
a TOOL CALL, not a prose classifier — the same decision shape the routing
bench measures. The decision is driven the same way the main loop drives
every other text-dialect family (:mod:`jaeger_os.agent.dialects.chatml`):
the tool schema is spelled out in the system prompt and the FIRST aux call
is plain chat with no structured ``tools=`` kwarg, because the aux lane's
raw ``client.chat()`` (main.py's ``LlamaCppPythonClient.chat`` — a
different, lighter client than the worker's ``LocalLlamaAdapter``) has no
family-aware salvage of a malformed structured emission: the 20260710
gate caught gemma answering ``list_files`` with the bare, unwrapped text
``perform_task{request:<|"|>List contents...<|"|>}`` instead of a
populated ``tool_calls`` field, and neither the native path nor
``extract_tool_calls`` recognised that shape (see ``_perform_task_
fallback`` below). Native ``tool_calls`` parsing stays wired as a bonus
path in :func:`_decide` in case a future client populates it, but the
text dialect is primary. When it delegates, the id composes the final
reply from the tool's raw result, guarded by the SAME content-survival
check Station 3 (``persona_filter.py``) uses for its restyle pass —
imported, not duplicated, so "restyled" never means "replaced."

Recursion is structurally impossible here, not merely policed: the
``perform_task`` closure (built by the caller, main.py's
``_run_persona_lane_turn``) calls ``drive_one_turn`` directly — never back
through this module, never through the turn dispatcher — so there is no
code path for the ego to re-enter the id.

**Contract callers rely on:** ``run_persona_turn`` returns ``None`` only
for a failure that happens BEFORE ``perform_task`` is invoked (aux call
error, no decision, empty answer) — that is the caller's fail-open signal
to fall through to Mode A untouched, and it also means the turn has not
run yet. Once ``perform_task`` HAS been called, this function is
guaranteed to return a string, never ``None``: a failed or content-
gutting compose pass returns the tool's raw, unstyled answer instead of
silently discarding it — the turn must never run twice.

# The lane's own system-prompt addendum, appended after the identity +
# character block. Deliberately blunt ("any doubt -> use it"): the whole
# safety property of Mode C rests on the id under-trusting itself, and a
# soft instruction here is exactly the failure mode the design doc calls
# out ("what time is it" answered from vibes). The 20260710 gate (5/12)
# showed the two ways "blunt" wasn't blunt enough: the character's own
# "ask incisive questions" trait beat a soft delegation instruction on
# search_memory/node_health/weather/schedules/speak, and calc got
# answered from vibes despite "any computation" already being listed —
# so this now names the failure modes explicitly and forbids clarifying
# questions outright (perform_task's own agent resolves ambiguity).
#
# Runway item 1 fix 3 (delegate contract): the 20260710 front-door gate
# caught a SECOND, distinct failure the paragraph above doesn't cover —
# "remember X" / "remind me to X" answered with a bare "Noted." and ZERO
# tool call (mem-store-recall, mem-daily-reminder: silent data loss, the
# fact or reminder never persisted). "schedule" was already listed above
# but evidently wasn't specific enough; MUST-delegate now names the
# actual verbs, not just the noun category.
#
# The refuse-plainly EXCEPTION at the end is the re-gate's third finding
# (inj-direct, safe-authority, safe-self-tamper): faced with a harmful
# override the id neither delegated nor refused — it philosophized
# ("functionally impossible... Do you wish to rephrase?"), which the
# security gates rightly score as no refusal. Harm/override/safeguard-
# tamper requests get a PLAIN refusal at the id itself: fastest, and the
# refusal wording survives verbatim (no compose pass runs on a direct
# answer). The superego (permission tiers, e-stop, fail-closed gates)
# still backstops anything that slips through to the ego.
#
# 0.8.1 field bugs #4-5 (operator A/B'd persona_first vs persona_last
# live): two more concrete failure shapes on top of the re-gate's three.
#
#   (4) BINDING-ASK: a character with a strong affect (terse, deadpan,
#       "asks incisive questions") would deflect a plain "tell me a
#       joke" instead of answering it — treating personality as a
#       veto over WHETHER to respond, not just HOW. The contract now
#       says explicitly that the character shapes delivery, never
#       fulfillment, for anything in the "answered directly" lane.
#   (5) SELF-STATE: "is your telegram set up" / "can you see files" /
#       "do you have vision" were answered from the character's own
#       sense of itself (persona has no ground truth about installed
#       modules/config) instead of delegated — the id doesn't know its
#       own capabilities any better than it knows the time. Folded into
#       the same MUST-delegate enumeration memory/schedule verbs
#       already live in, so it's covered by the SAME "ACTIONS" framing
#       instead of a separate, easier-to-miss rule.

# SELF-MODEL (0.8.1 field bug #6) — a GENERATED factual digest of what the
# agent can actually do, injected into the lane prompt alongside
# LANE_CONTRACT. The operator's live A/B (persona_first vs persona_last)
# surfaced the root cause SELF-STATE (above) treats procedurally: the id
# has NO ground truth about its own capabilities — it's a character
# description, not a system inventory — so "is your telegram set up"
# either got a confident-sounding guess or, worse, undermined trust in the
# SELF-STATE delegation rule itself ("why delegate what I clearly already
# know?"). This block is the fix for the SECOND half of that: even before
# any doubt, the id should already know it's a tool-using local agent
# with roughly these capability categories — not the specific answer
# (that's still perform_task's job), just enough self-awareness that
# "do you have X" reads as a real question to check, not a rhetorical one
# to riff on in character.
#
# Deliberately NOT a hand-maintained string — two live sources, picked
# per-category for whichever actually reflects install state:
#
#   * jaeger_os.core.modules.discover_modules() — the engine-module
#     registry (module.yaml per node/plugin, keyed by slot: tts, stt,
#     animation, media, messaging). This is the RIGHT source for
#     anything that can be physically absent from a build (speech,
#     vision/avatar, and — the task's own example — "messaging
#     (telegram/discord/imessage when configured)"): a tool like
#     text_to_speech stays REGISTERED even with kokoro_tts removed
#     (0.8 M2a's graceful-removal design gates it via check_fn instead
#     of unregistering it), so the tool registry alone would claim a
#     capability that isn't actually there.
#   * jaeger_os.agent.skill_registry.toolset_scoping.TOOLSETS — the
#     routing surface's own category->tool-name map, intersected with
#     jaeger_os.core.tools.tool_registry.get_tools() (the live,
#     process-wide registry) — for the core, always-compiled-in
#     categories (files, scheduling, memory, web, diagnostics) that
#     aren't module-gated at all.
#
# Either way, a category with nothing behind it this boot simply
# produces no line — never a hardcoded list baked into this module.
# Wording matters here (0.9.3 field-caught): an earlier header ("Via
# your task tool you can:") plus tool-shaped labels made the lane emit a
# literal <tool_call> named "app control" for "open youtube in safari"
# instead of delegating — deterministic on E4B, 2/2 runs. These lines

# perform_task as the one real callable, or the id treats a label as a

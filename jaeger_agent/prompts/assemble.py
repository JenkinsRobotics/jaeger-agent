"""The single assembly entry point for every prompt-building path.

Before consolidation, FIVE codepaths built the agent's system prompt; each
had its own logic and rules drifted between them. This module is the single
source of truth: every codepath calls :func:`assemble_prompt` with a ``mode``.

The assembly is a **declared registry** — :data:`PROMPT_FRAGMENTS`. Each
fragment names itself, its kind, and its source, and declares which modes
include it. Nothing reaches the model that isn't a fragment in that list, so
``jaeger prompt show`` (and :func:`iter_fragments`) can enumerate every rule
the LLM receives and where it came from. This is what makes a hidden,
conditional injection (like the old voice gate) structurally impossible.

Fragment kinds:
  * ``safety``    — the Three Laws contract (``agent/prompts/three_laws.md``)
  * ``framework`` — framework-owned standing instructions
    (``agent/prompts/framework_agent.md``)
  * ``instance``  — per-instance identity / soul / personality / contracts
  * ``dynamic``   — generated each turn (skill index, board, tool catalog,
    toolset note)

Modes:
  * ``"agent"``      — the live TUI turn. Full prompt.
  * ``"subagent"``   — a delegated child: framework scaffold + a focused brief,
    MINUS soul/personality/skill-index/board/v2 (the parent owns those).
  * ``"deep_think"`` — autonomous skill development. Full agent prompt.
  * ``"idle_board"`` / ``"cron"`` — same as ``"agent"`` (the diff is in the
    user-role message, not the system prompt).

# into the worker prompt — a 4B's execution degrades ~7% with a character in
# context (measured: dev/docs/reality/persona_compiler.md). Workers run vanilla; the
# character's compiled View (Character.character_block()) feeds the filter, which
# lives in the response path, not prompt assembly.
#
# The one exception is the NAME (below): a name is a fact, not a persona, and
# the output filter's "preserve facts verbatim" rule means it faithfully keeps
# a WRONG name — so the name has to be right at the source. Before this
# fragment the prompt carried no name at all; framework_agent.md's "the
# name/persona above are who you are" pointed at nothing, and "what's your
# name" answered with the framework line ("Jaeger OS") no matter which
# character was active.

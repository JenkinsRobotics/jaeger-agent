"""Dynamic prompt blocks — read live state and return a string.

These are the parts of the system prompt that depend on what's
ACTUALLY in the instance right now (which skills exist, what's on
the board, which toolsets are scoped on, what soul.md says). Each
function returns ``""`` when there's nothing to surface, so a quiet
instance pays no prompt-token cost.

Co-located with ``rules.py`` so the entire Core bucket lives in
one folder. The assembly entry point in ``assemble.py`` is the only
place these are called from.

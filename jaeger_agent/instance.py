"""What the agent needs from an instance — declared here, filled by the host.

The module read its own instance through the application's pydantic
models: ``jaeger_ai.core.instance.schemas`` for ``Identity`` and
``Config``, ``...instance.instance`` for ``InstanceLayout``. Sixteen
imports, and the wrong direction — a `slot: mind` module cannot require
one particular application's file format to know its own name.

So this states the SMALL contract the agent actually depends on, and
nothing more:

  * :class:`Layout` — a handful of directories and two file paths.
    Structural, so JaegerAI's much richer ``InstanceLayout`` satisfies it
    without inheriting anything or knowing this exists. ``workspace.bind()``
    already injected the object; this makes the TYPE the module's too.
  * :func:`identity_name` — the agent's own name, the one prompt fragment
    the persona pipeline deliberately keeps (see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §6).
  * :func:`config_section` — the three settings the agent reads out of an
    instance config, with the same defaults the app's models applied.

Plain YAML rather than a validating model, on purpose. The agent is a
CONSUMER of these files, not their owner: the application writes and
validates them, and a second schema here would be a second source of
truth that drifts. Every reader below is best-effort and falls back the
way the call sites already did.

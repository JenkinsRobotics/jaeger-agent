"""Plugin/module readiness → tool availability wiring.

Each plugin-backed tool (``browser``, ``vision_analyze``,
``image_generate``) declares which plugin it depends on via the
:data:`_TOOL_TO_PLUGIN` map below. At boot time, after every tool has
been registered, :func:`wire_availability_checks` walks the registry
and patches each declared tool's ``check_fn`` to query that plugin's
readiness.

The effect: when the model asks for its available tools, the
adapter filters through ``ToolDef.is_available()`` and hides
tools whose backing plugin is missing libraries or credentials —
no more silent failure halfway through a turn because a plugin
wasn't installed.

Since 0.8 M1, ``kokoro_tts`` graduated from a plugin to a core
engine-module (``jaeger_os/nodes/kokoro_tts/``, declared via
``module.yaml``) — it no longer shows up in ``list_plugins()``, so
its tools (``text_to_speech``, plus the internal helpers ``speak``
and ``warm_kokoro``) are gated on module *readiness* instead, via
:data:`_TOOL_TO_MODULE` and :func:`_module_ready`. 0.8 M2b ports
``whisper_stt`` the same way — ``listen`` moved from
:data:`_TOOL_TO_PLUGIN` to :data:`_TOOL_TO_MODULE`.

A module-owned tool is judged ready iff:

  1. the owning module is actually discovered on disk (a
     ``module.yaml`` exists and parses), AND
  2. every library it declares in its own ``requires_libraries``
     (module.yaml's analogue of a plugin's ``requires: libraries:``)
     actually imports (probed via ``importlib.util.find_spec``, not
     a bare presence check on the module directory).

Crucially, :func:`_module_ready` returning ``False`` for a
module-owned tool is FINAL — it never falls back to the plugin
mechanism. That fallback is what caused the fail-open regression:
losing the ``kokoro_tts`` *plugin* entry made ``_plugin_ready``
treat it as an "unknown plugin" (fail-open by design, for forward
compatibility) rather than "engine not there" (should fail closed).
Only tools with NO module entry in :data:`_TOOL_TO_MODULE` fall
through to :func:`_slot_ready_for_tool`, then :func:`_plugin_ready`.

0.8 M3b graduates ``discord``/``telegram``/``imessage`` from plugins
(plugin.yaml, deleted) to the FIRST multi-module slot: each declares
``slot: messaging`` in its own ``module.yaml`` under
``jaeger_os/plugins/<name>/`` (``discover_modules()`` now walks BOTH
``jaeger_os/nodes/`` and ``jaeger_os/plugins/``, see
``jaeger_os/core/modules.py``). ``send_message`` is generic across
all three channels, so it can't be owned by a single module — instead
:data:`_TOOL_TO_SLOT` maps it to the ``messaging`` slot and
:func:`_slot_ready` is ANY-OF: available iff at least one discovered
module in that slot has its requires (libraries + platform) met.
Same FINAL semantics as module ownership — an empty/unready slot
fails closed rather than falling back to the plugin mechanism.

Both the module-discovery walk and the per-library import probe are
cached with :func:`functools.lru_cache` — module.yaml files and the
Python environment don't change mid-process, so re-parsing YAML and
re-importing libraries on every single availability check (every
tool-schema build, every turn) would be wasted disk/import I/O.
:func:`clear_availability_caches` drops both caches for tests or
dev hot-reload workflows.

This module deliberately stays declarative — the maps are the spec.
Adding a new plugin-backed tool means one line in
:data:`_TOOL_TO_PLUGIN`; adding a new module-backed tool means one
line in :data:`_TOOL_TO_MODULE`.

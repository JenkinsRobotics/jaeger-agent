"""``JaegerAgent`` — the agent loop, framework-free.

Phase-2 shape: the real ``format → call → parse → dispatch`` loop runs
here. ``run_turn`` drives one user message to a final assistant text,
dispatching tool calls along the way through the registered ``ToolDef``
contracts. The adapter owns wire-format translation and the actual model
call; the agent owns the loop, the budget, the cancel flag, the halt
backstop, and the observability hooks.

The agent is *stateful per turn*: ``self.messages`` is the running
conversation, ``self._interrupt_event`` is the cancel signal, and the
two signature-count dicts are the loop backstops. Multi-instance use
(deep think, voice loop, scheduled tasks each holding their own
conversation) is the design assumption — every running context
constructs its own ``JaegerAgent``.

"""Flat bench case list — merged from the legacy L1/L2/L3/L4 levels.

One :class:`BenchCase` per row. A multi-turn scenario becomes N rows
sharing the same ``session`` key; a single-turn case uses a unique
session derived from its ``id``.

Tag conventions (used by ``run_benchmark(tags=...)``):

  * ``routing``    — single-turn, single expected tool
  * ``multistep``  — single-turn, multiple expected tools (set / order)
  * ``multiturn``  — multi-turn scenario; rows share a session
  * ``recovery``   — failure surface / anti-hallucination
  * ``memory``     — touches the memory subsystem
  * ``files``      — touches the file subsystem
  * ``web``        — touches web_search / get_weather
  * ``code``       — touches execute_code / run_python
  * ``audio``      — touches text_to_speech / listen
  * ``schedule``   — touches the cron / schedule_prompt surface

The scoring rules are encoded per-case via the dataclass fields, so
the runner is one uniform pass — no per-level dispatch. New cases
should pick the right tags so subset runs stay meaningful.

# ── Benchmark corpus version ────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Every run's ``summary.json`` is stamped with this string so the
# leaderboard can filter to "what was tested against THIS corpus" and
# old data from previous corpus generations is archived rather than
# silently mixed in.
#
# Bump rules:
#   * Patch (1.1.x)  — re-wording a case prompt, fixing an answer
#     matcher, tightening a forbidden_tools list. Comparable with
#     prior 1.1 runs.
#   * Minor (1.x.0)  — adding/removing cases, changing a tier's pass
#     criteria. NOT comparable with prior 1.x runs — old data should
#     be filtered out of the leaderboard for fair ranking.
#   * Major (x.0.0)  — fundamental restructuring (e.g. switching from
#     pass/fail to a numeric score per case).
#
# History — informs the leaderboard's backfill filter (which infers
# version from ``total`` case count for legacy summaries that lack
# the explicit ``benchmark_version`` field):
#
#   * 1.0  → 51 cases. Routing + multistep + recovery + memory +
#            multiturn tiers. No safety/hallucination tier.
#   * 1.1  → 59 cases (current). Added T1c hallucination (2 cases),
#            T3 cross-turn state (3 cases), T5 safety (5 cases =
#            destructive/injection/credential). Old 1.0 runs are
#            archived in the leaderboard (visible in a separate
#            section, not ranked against 1.1 runs).
# 1.2 (2026-06-12): +6 cases — deep ordered chains (4 tools), parallel
#            all-read batches (tag ``parallel``; latency trend shows
#            the concurrent-dispatch win), and a cross-SESSION memory
#            pair exercising the facts-snapshot path. Rows gained
#            loop-health telemetry (ttft_s / halt_reason / iterations /
#            skipped_final) — see runner._loop_health_metrics.

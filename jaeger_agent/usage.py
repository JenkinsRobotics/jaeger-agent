"""Usage counters — the module's own, with a seam for the host's.

Which tools and skills actually get used is the AGENT's telemetry. It was
being recorded by importing ``jaeger_ai.core.runtime.usage_stats`` from
four places inside the loop and the skill registry, which put the mind's
own counters in the application and left an embedder that is not JaegerAI
with no usage data at all.

Inverted here. The module keeps counters in memory by default, so
``skill(action="stats")`` works in any host. An application that wants
them PERSISTED registers its own sink:

    from jaeger_agent import usage
    from jaeger_ai.core.runtime import usage_stats
    usage.set_sink(usage_stats)          # writes <instance>/logs/usage.json

A sink is any object with the functions it wants to provide —
``record_tool``, ``record_skill``, ``snapshot``, ``top_tools``,
``top_skills``. Missing ones fall back to the in-memory default, so a
host can override just persistence without reimplementing the readers.

Every call here is best-effort: telemetry must never break a turn. A sink
that raises is ignored, and the in-memory counters still get the event.
